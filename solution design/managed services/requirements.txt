🧩 SCENARIO 1 (MVP – Must Implement First)
🎯 Goal

Digitize shift and leave management, track availability, and generate monthly HR shift reports (with shift allowance).

Features (Scenario 1)
1️⃣ Shift & Allowance Management

Store daily shift details per employee:

Morning / Afternoon / Night.

Automatically count shifts for the month.

Allow HR report export:

Format: Excel or PDF.

Includes employee name, total shifts, shift type count, total allowance = (shift count × shift allowance price).

2️⃣ Leave & Comp-Off Handling

Record leaves (sick, planned, etc.).

Automatically suggest or allow assigning someone with comp-off to cover.

Update both employees’ shift counts accordingly.

3️⃣ Employee Profile & Contact Info

Each employee record includes:

Name, Employee ID

Role (L1/L2/L3)

Company email

Personal phone

Daily status: Working / Leave / Compoff / Holiday

Availability status visible in roster view.

4️⃣ Daily Status Dashboard

Show all employees for today:

Who is working?

Who is on leave?

Who is on comp-off?

When arranging replacement → show only available staff.

5️⃣ HR Report Generation

Generate monthly summary report:

Employee → Shift counts → Total allowance.

Include variable allowance price (editable by lead).

Export and share via email (to HR).

💾 Data Model (Scenario 1)
Table	Columns
Employees	emp_id, name, role, company_email, personal_phone, shift_count_morning, shift_count_afternoon, shift_count_night, total_allowance, status
Shifts	shift_id, emp_id, date, shift_type (morning/afternoon/night), status (working/leave/compoff), isReplacement (bool)
Leaves	leave_id, emp_id, date_from, date_to, reason, approved_by
Config	allowance_rate_morning, allowance_rate_afternoon, allowance_rate_night
🧱 Recommended Tech Stack (for Performance + Production Feasibility)
Layer	Recommendation	Reason
Frontend (App)	Android (Kotlin) — modern, stable	Kotlin is preferred for new Android projects; Java version can be parallelly maintained
Backend (Option 1 – MVP)	Firebase Firestore	Real-time sync, no server setup, easy for multi-user (lead + HR + staff)
Backend (Option 2 – Company-ready)	Spring Boot (Java) + MySQL (or PostgreSQL) hosted on internal server or AWS	Enterprise-friendly, scalable, secure
Auth	Firebase Auth or company’s internal SSO	For secure login
Reporting	Generate Excel using Apache POI or PDF via iText	Compatible with HR workflows
Notifications	Firebase Cloud Messaging	Notify leads when leave or shift change occurs

🧩 SCENARIO 2 (Phase 2 – Enhancement)
🎯 Goal

Automatically compare app’s shift data with employees’ time sheet to verify attendance.

Features

Upload or sync timesheet data.

Match dates and shifts.

Highlight mismatches for HR.

Auto-calculate final approved shift allowance.

Stack Upgrade

Use backend microservice (Java Spring Boot).

Schedule nightly jobs (e.g., using cron or Firebase Functions).

🧩 SCENARIO 3 (Phase 3 – Productivity Reporting)
🎯 Goal

Automate daily productivity report submission and notification to manager/CEO.

Features

Each employee fills “tasks worked on” for the shift.

Auto-capture:

Issue calls handled (for L1),

Deployments done (L2/L3),

Alerts resolved.

Generate “Daily Productivity Sheet”.

Notify Manager → Auto-email CEO once approved.

Stack Upgrade

Add “Tasks” table and manager approval workflow.

Use background jobs for scheduled report mailing.
